This document is the API specification for Asakusa Framework.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Asakusa is a Hadoop-based Enterprise Batch Processing Framework, to improve the efficiency of General Enterprise Systems (e.g. Supply Chain Management). Asakusa provides the DAG-based development methodology, which must be required for the large scale batch jobs. With Asakusa, the developers can build up the scalable and robust enterprise batch jobs easily and comprehensively.
</p>
<p>
Asakusa consists of the following components: (1) MapReduce DSL compiler (Ashigel Compiler), (2) a data model generator for Hadoop data format, and (3) integrated test suites tools. Ashigel compiler compiles the DSLs (multi-layered DSLs, business workflow DSL, logic flow DSL, and data operator DSL) into MapReduce programs. The model generator takes RDBMS schema as an input, and generates the Hadoop I/O classes and the corresponding test codes. For the ease of the development, the test suite tools integrate the Ashigel compiler and the model generator.
